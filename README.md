This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Plans:
- Add subtasks, to split huge goal to smaller subgoals to make it more achievable
- Access settings for the goals: Private / Public. It  would allow to create a system of followers and motivate followers to learn things that shared profi in some branch.
- Motivate
- PWA to have an offline access to app, that could be stored on device
- Web workers to have dynamic data change
